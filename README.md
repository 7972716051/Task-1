# Task-1
A landing page designed for begginers using HTML and CSS!

Building this landing page was a fantastic way to dive into essential web design concepts and sharpen my skills. I have learn how to add columns, divide sections, arrange items, add headers, footers. Most importantly,i have use my creativity to make the page look impressive. The alignments, the padding, the color palette, boxes and all the other elements on the page require attention. 
Here’s what I focused on:
▫️ Modern, Eye-catching Design: Created a clean and engaging layout to grab attention and make navigation easy.
▫️ Responsive Layout: Built with mobile responsiveness in mind to ensure it looks great on all devices.
▫️ Creative Use of CSS: From color palettes to smooth hover effects, every detail was carefully styled to enhance the user experience.

This project taught me the importance of alignment, spacing, and visual hierarchy—key elements that bring a landing page to life. Excited to keep building and growing!
